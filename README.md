# Sportradar Live Scoreboard Library

A cleanly architected TypeScript library that manages live World Cup football matches with object-oriented design, TDD, and best engineering practices â€” inspired by Sportradar's Odds Tribe.

## Features

- Start, update, and finish matches in memory
- Summary list ordered by total score, then recency
- 100% test coverage with Jest
- Designed for React, cloud, and future service integrations

## Getting Started

```bash
npm install
npm test
```

## Design Principles

- Clean code with encapsulated logic (Match, Scoreboard)
- TDD with expressive test names
- OOP with clear separation of domain and service
- No framework dependencies
